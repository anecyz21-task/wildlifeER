# Software Requirements Specification

## Purpose  

WildlifeER(WLER)’s main purpose is to provide a communication platform for general public to save more injured wildlife together. The application offers public individuals a chance to work together to bring more found injured animals to local hospitals and shelters by receiving and sharing animal information and hospital information through the app. The data over injured animals collected by the app through posts will be useful data for researchers, wildlife professionals, and local governments for future research and analysis. Lastly, the WildlifeER will provide comprehensive educational resources for users in order to facilitate the recue process and for long-term education among the public.  

### Definitions  

Wildlife: Native/non-native wild animals that cannot and should not be kept domestically.  

Wildlife hospitals/shelters: Organizations that receive certain types of injured wildlife to help them recover or euthanasia。 

Wildlife professionals: People who practice careers in the field of wildlife protection, research or relevant fields closely connected to wildlife. 

Department of Fish and Wildlife: Governmental officials that practice activities in wildlife protection, research, environmental protection and control, and other relevant fields.  

Volunteer: People recognized by any wildlife protection organization or WildlifeER for their volunteer skills and effort through learning and real-life practice.  

Status for wildlife posts: Each wildlife post should display a status indicating the various stages of the rescue process. The status is one of the three: the animal is being picked up, captured, and transported to a hospital.   

Volunteer Skill Evaluation: Volunteers with advanced skills and intend to assist with more restricted species should demonstrate their ability to handle animals requiring more advanced skills, such as raptors or baby bobcats, by providing proof of relevant training and experience.  

-  Beginner Volunteer: Their skills should include but not limited to basic animal care (feeding, cleaning enclosures), general wildlife observation and monitoring and basic first aid knowledge for minor injuries (cuts, scratches). 

- Intermediate Volunteer: Their skills should include but not limited to comfortable handling small, non-dangerous animals (e.g., birds, rabbits), participating in wildlife rescues under supervision, basic understanding of animal behavior and species identification and familiarity with common rehabilitation equipment. 

- Advanced Volunteer: Their skills should include but not limited to experience in handling larger or more dangerous animals (e.g., raptors, bobcats, snakes), knowledgeable in animal behavior, able to identify stress signals or aggressive postures, able to administer basic medical treatments and participation in wildlife rescue and rehabilitation independently or as team leads. 

- Expert Volunteer: Their skills should include but not limited to highly specialized in working with endangered species or highly dangerous wildlife, capable of rehabilitating injured wildlife from intake to release and skilled in educating the public or peers about wildlife conservation efforts. 

 

## Background 

Many injured wildlife is found every day around the states. People post pictures and videos about these injured animals showing empathy and sadness but do not know how to help them. Some don’t even know that these animals can be helped and cured.  Thus, WildlifeER is here to help share information and education resources among the public, volunteers, and wildlife hospitals to help cure and release more wildlife back into nature. Recognizing the key issue is that the public knows little about the power they can do in wildlife protection, WildlifeER intends to form a communication network that connects public individuals, volunteers and local wildlife organizations where people can post and search wildlife information within the app. Through posts, educational resources, and communication, various sides can form a chain to find, transport, and cure found injured wildlife.  

What’s more, data resources are always useful for wildlife professionals and researchers. Thus, WildlifeER will collect the data provided by our users through their posts and incorporate these data into useable databases for future research purposes of wildlife professionals.  

 

## Overall Description:  

### User Characteristics  

-  General Public 

People who are interested in helping wildlife regardless of their wildlife knowledge. Usually general public are not equipped with a lot of wildlife knowledge.  

Though any people may find an injured wildlife, because of the number of public members, usually they help find injured wildlife and bring them to local wildlife hospitals.  

-  Wildlife Volunteers 

Current recognized volunteers of a wildlife protection organization or WildlifeER. Volunteers are very interested in helping wildlife and are equipped with certain wildlife knowledge based on their experience. Volunteers’ skills may vary a lot due to their experience and training received. 

Volunteers can assist non-profit organizations to cure and rehabilitate injured wildlife based on their level of training and experience.  

-  Wildlife Professionals 

People practicing their career in the field of wildlife protection, research, or other relevant fields.  Equipped with high level of knowledge related to wildlife and relevant topics.  

Wildlife professionals are usually responsible for treating injured wildlife and practicing relevant research.   

-  Fish and Wildlife Department Officials 

People who are governmental officials that practice careers in protecting 		wildlife(usually large carnivores like bears and bobcats). Equipped with high 	   level of knowledge related to wildlife and relevant topics.   

Officials are responsible for capturing, transporting and treating large animals 	or endangered animals with local wildlife organizations.
